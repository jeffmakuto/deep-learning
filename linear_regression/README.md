# Linear Regression Demo

This folder contains a short notebook demonstrating linear regression concepts and a static HTML export for quick viewing.

Contents

- `linear_regression_demo.ipynb` — Notebook with a small linear regression example (data, model, diagnostics).
- `linear_regression_demo.html` — Exported HTML version of the notebook.

How to use

1. Install dependencies (top-level `requirements.txt` generally covers the required packages for the demos).
2. Open `linear_regression_demo.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run the notebook cells.
3. To view results without running code, open the HTML export in a browser.

Notes

- This demo is meant for learning and experimentation, not as a production pipeline.
