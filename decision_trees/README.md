# Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods

This folder contains a hands-on notebook and an exported HTML report demonstrating decision tree models and ensemble techniques (bagging, random forests, and boosting). The materials are intended as an educational walkthrough of tree-based methods, evaluation, and practical considerations.

Contents

- `ensemble_workflow.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and experiments.
- `ensemble_workflow.html` — Exported HTML version of the notebook for quick viewing in a browser.
- `decision_tree_ensemble_methods.pdf` — Supplementary notes / slides (if present).

How to use

1. Create/activate a Python environment and install needed packages (see top-level `requirements.txt` and add `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` as needed).
2. Open `ensemble_workflow.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells interactively.
3. To view quickly without running, open `ensemble_workflow.html` in your browser.

Notes

- This folder is focused on notebooks and educational artifacts; there are no production-ready training scripts here.
